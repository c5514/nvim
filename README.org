* Requirements:
- Neovim $\geq$0.9.5
- Zathura
- Texlive
* Includes:
- Snippets for TeX files written using Luasnips(it is recommended to see read the snippets written in /nvim/lua/snippets/tex/) and imported from https://github.com/rafamadriz/friendly-snippets.git
- Vimtex to compile TeX files.
* Warning:
- I enabled the transparent background in one-dark theme because I prefer to use kitty's background. Deactivate the transparency if you don't like it.
- I just tested it in Fedora Minimal after installing the requirements specified. If you use other distro this may not be enough.
